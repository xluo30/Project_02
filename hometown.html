<h2>Scenery</h2>
<p>There is an interest thing in Chongqing is that navigation will failuer. Because the terrian is very complex in Chongqing. Chongqing covers a large area crisscrossed by rivers and mountains. The Daba Mountains stand in the north, the Wu Mountains in the east, the Wuling Mountains in the southeast, and the Dalou Mountains in the south. The whole area slopes down from north and south towards the Yangtze River valley, with sharp rises and falls. The area is featured by a large geological massif, of mountains and hills, with large sloping areas at different heights. Typical karst landscape is common in this area, and stone forests, numerous collections of peaks, limestone caves and valleys can be found in many places. </p>

<h3>Weather</h3>
<h4>Chongqing is famous for the weather in China. Because it so hot in summer! There are some reasons.</h4>
<p>1.Chongqing locates near the Tropic of Cancer, where receives much heat from the sun.</p>
<p>2.The city is surrounded by mountains so wind cannot take heat away like other plain cities.</p>
<p>3.Admittedly, Chongqing is not lack of water, but due to its specific geographical location, water vapour is kept in low attitude, absorb the heat in air, which increase the temperature.</p>
<p>4.The pollution. Dust lower the rising speed of water vapor, which higher the temperature.</p>
<p>5.Last one, the Three Gorges Project. It raise the level of water, make the river like a bucket. The running water could take the heat away, but now, the water is kept in dam.</p>
