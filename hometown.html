The Daba Mountains stand in the north, the Wu Mountains in the east, the Wuling Mountains in the southeast, and the Dalou Mountains in the south. The whole area slopes down from north and south towards the Yangtze River valley, with sharp rises and falls.

<p>2.Chongqing locates near the Tropic of Cancer, where receives much heat from the sun.</p>
<p>3.The city is surrounded by mountains so wind cannot take heat away like other plain cities.</p>
<p>4.Admittedly, Chongqing is not lack of water, but due to its specific geographical location, water vapour is kept in low attitude, absorb the heat in air, which increase the temperature.</p>
<p>5.The pollution. Dust lower the rising speed of water vapor, which higher the temperature.</p>
